# fret-finder
A Python tool for optimizing guitar tabs by transposing notes to more ergonomic fret and string positions. It uses the highest fret in each beat as an anchor and shifts other notes accordingly. Designed to optimize tabs that have large vertical stretches and slides, making them easier to play with cleaner, more horizontal fingering.
